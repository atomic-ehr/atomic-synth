# Compare basic POC with Synthea [pending]

To evaluate the POC architecture, we need to compare it with current Synthea implementation.

* [ ] Understand how Synthea works in general - use `./docs/synthea` and source code `./refs/synthea/src/main/java/org/mitre/synthea/*`
* [ ] Understand our current implementation - use `./docs/architecture.md` and source code `./src/*`
* [ ] Document the differences in this task file
* [ ] Analyze the diff and suggest should we update current architecture based on synthea ideas or not, describe motivation for the decision
* [ ] Suggest next steps by generating new task file in `./tasks/<timestamp>-<suggested-task-name>.md`
