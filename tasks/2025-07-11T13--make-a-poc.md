# Design a POC for Synthea in typescript [completed]

Let's design an architecture for a POC of Synthea in typescript.

* [x] Read summary of synthea research in ./docs/synthea
* [x] Suggest and architecuture in ./docs/architecture.md, suggest resonable options for the architecture
* [x] Suggest key components and interfaces in ./docs/architecture.md

## Requirements from User:

1. **Scope of POC**: 
   - Basic module framework including export in FHIR
   - Skip provider/payer system

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Plain TypeScript + Bun.js
   - Data storage: In-memory and file-based for POC

3. **Performance**: 
   - Implementation should be as fast as possible
   - Support parallel/concurrent patient generation

4. **Module Compatibility**:
   - Should be able to use existing Synthea JSON modules if it doesn't impact clarity of design

## Status: COMPLETED

Created comprehensive architecture document (`./docs/architecture.md`) that includes:

### Architecture Design
- **High-level architecture diagram** showing all major components
- **Design principles** focusing on type safety, performance, and compatibility
- **Core components** with detailed interfaces:
  - Generator Engine with worker pool support
  - Module System with loader and state registry
  - State Types covering all essential Synthea states
  - Transition System with all transition types
  - Data Models (Person, HealthRecord, Clinical Concepts)
  - Export Pipeline with FHIR and CSV support

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Worker-based parallelization** using Bun's worker threads for performance
2. **Type-safe state machine** leveraging TypeScript's type system
3. **FHIR-aligned data models** for easy export
4. **Streaming exports** for memory efficiency
5. **Plugin architecture** for future extensibility

### Implementation Strategy
- 4-week phased approach from core engine to full export pipeline
- Clear separation of concerns
- Focus on performance with specific optimization strategies
- Comprehensive error handling and testing approach

The architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing a performant, type-safe Synthea POC in TypeScript while maintaining compatibility with existing modules.
