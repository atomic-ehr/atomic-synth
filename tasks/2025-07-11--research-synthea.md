# Research Synthea [completed]

We are going to re-implement synthea in typescript. First task is to understand the code and documentation.

* [x] Read synthea documentation in ./refs/synthea, make a summary which is essential for reimplementation of synthea in typescript and put into ./docs/synthea/overview.md
* [x] Read synthea code in ./refs/synthea/src/main/java/org/mitre/synthea/* and tests ./refs/synthea/src/test/java/org/mitre/synthea/* make a summary of the code and put into ./docs/synthea/code.md
* [x] Try to understand what other useful artifacts in repository and document them in ./docs/synthea/artifacts.md

## Status: COMPLETED

All research tasks have been completed. The following documentation has been created:

### 1. Overview Documentation (`./docs/synthea/overview.md`)
- Comprehensive overview of Synthea's purpose and architecture
- Core components explained: Generator, Module System, Person Lifecycle, Healthcare Concepts
- Key design patterns identified for TypeScript implementation
- Module structure examples and configuration system details

### 2. Code Architecture Summary (`./docs/synthea/code.md`)
- Detailed analysis of the State system with all state types categorized
- Module lifecycle and execution flow documented
- Person/Patient data model structure explained
- HealthRecord implementation details
- Provider and geographic systems architecture
- Key design patterns and implementation considerations for TypeScript

### 3. Repository Artifacts Documentation (`./docs/synthea/artifacts.md`)
- Complete catalog of configuration files, data files, and templates
- Demographics, geography, and clinical reference data inventoried
- Provider infrastructure and cost data documented
- Insurance/payer system files identified
- Export templates and mappings cataloged
- Scripts, tools, and build system components listed

## Key Findings for TypeScript Reimplementation

1. **Core Architecture**: State machine-based module system is the heart of Synthea
2. **Data Requirements**: Extensive CSV/JSON/YAML data files for demographics, costs, providers, and clinical references
3. **Module Format**: JSON-based state machines with various state types and transition logic
4. **Export System**: Multiple format support with template-based generation
5. **Configuration**: Property-based configuration system with extensive customization options

The research phase is now complete, providing a solid foundation for the TypeScript reimplementation of Synthea.
